# Hello world docker action

This action computes the fibbonacci numbers of numbers found in a pr.
it and extracts numerical values from the pr and stores in a vector.
iterates over each element of the vector while mapping the elements less than a defined  threshold to a new vector containing the fibonacci of the elements that satisfy the cridential

it then posts a the result ad comment to the pr
